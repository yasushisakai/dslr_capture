dslr-capture captures the preview image from your camera and displays it.

how to use:
it depends on gphoto2 and sdl2.

mac:
brew install gphoto2 sdl2 sdl2-image

other OS platforms have better support using different solutions, see below.

compatible cameras:

you can find hope if the below list contains your camera model and has
'Liveview' and/or 'Image Capture' in the Additional Abilities row.

I've only tested it using a Sony-Î±7s.

expected usage:
I made this to feed it to obs. There were similar solutions like Camera
Live(https://github.com/v002/v002-Camera-Live) and Cascable Pro
Webcam(https://cascable.se/) but neither did not work with my combination of
devices. MacOS and Sony.

If you are a Linux user, gphotos manual (http://gphoto.org/doc/remote/) works.
If you are a Windows user, sony provides its own software to capture camera
preview.

Once being able to feed to obs, obs can create a virtual camera, which you
can use it with zoom and other web conference systems.

next steps: skip obs and directly populate a virtual camera device. (more into macOS)
